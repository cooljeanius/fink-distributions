DescPackaging: <<
	Former maintainer: Stefan Bruda <fink@bruda.ca>

	The application is in fact self-contained to a very large degree.
	"mupdf" symlink included for consistency with the man pages.

	Build system mixes included and externally supplied flavors of
	several libs, which gives an unreliable build and
	unpredictable result. Work hard to use externals whenever
	possible.

	Hack the heck out of lcms external support (slightly higher
	BDep of lcms2mt2 to avoid a broken lcms2mt.pc that was
	transiently in fink)
