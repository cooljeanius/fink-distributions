Description: LaTeX->HTML (-ppdf variant gives old behavior
DescPackaging: <<
 The source file changed in October 2004 without the name changing.
 We have thus made a new fink package based on the new source file,
 and we rename it for storage within fink.  One of the changes was
 a version number within the file latex2html.pin, which changed from
 1.70 to 1.71.
<<
DescPort: <<
There is considerable discussion online about supressing "-Ppdf" during
latex2html's call to dvips, in order to avoid lines underneath images: see 
for example 
http://ccrma-www.stanford.edu/~jos/webpub/Eliminating_Black_Rules_Under.html

On the other hand, there is a reason for that call, in ensuring that scalable
fonts are used in the output: see for example
http://web.mit.edu/acs/faq/webmath/samples_and_tools.html

So for now, fink users will have a choice.  The default behavior is to suppress
"-Ppdf" (which is new), but the package latex2html-ppdf restores the original
behavior.

We substitute /bin/ls for mkteklsr during compile/install to avoid problems
if mktexlsr is not present on the system.  We run mktexlsr (if present) in
a Post Install script instead.
