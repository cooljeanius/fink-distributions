Description: The Z Shell with multibyte support
DescDetail: <<
To make the Fink zsh your default user shell, do the following:
  1. Add the line %p/bin/zsh to the file /etc/shells
  2. Execute the following command: chsh -s %p/bin/zsh
  3. Open a new terminal session.
.
Zsh is a shell designed for interactive use, although it is also
a powerful scripting language. Many of the useful features of bash,
ksh, and tcsh were incorporated into zsh; many original
features were added. Its syntax is that of an augmented ksh.
It is recommended that you read
	http://zsh.sunsite.dk/Intro/intro_toc.html
before installing this shell.
You might also consider installing the zsh-helpfiles package.
<<
DescUsage: <<
	All config files should be kept in %p/etc/zsh.
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
ATTENTION ATTENTION
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This shell is NOT preconfigured. Sample configure scripts
can be found in your %p/share/doc/zsh directory
You may manually move those sample files to
%p/etc/zsh or alter them to your liking!

Documentation is included by default, please read
it carefully. In addition, the zsh-helpfiles package
provides additional documentation.
