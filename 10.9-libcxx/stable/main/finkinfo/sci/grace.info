Description: Data processing and 2-D visualization tool
DescDetail: <<
Grace is a Motif/Lesstif application for two-dimensional data
visualization. Grace can transform the data using free equations, FFT,
cross- and auto-correlation, differences, integrals, histograms, and
much more. The generated figures are of high quality. Grace is a very
convenient tool for data inspection, data transformation, and for
making figures for publications.
<<
DescUsage:  <<
The graphical executable name is "xmgrace".

The default help viewer is "open", i.e. whatever the default browser you have
your system set to, and the default editor is nano (because I thought it was 
the most user-friendly default option).
You can override the default help viewer and editor settings via the
GRACE_HELPVIEWER and GRACE_EDITOR environment variables, respectively.
For example, if you're running xmgrace in a remote X11 session, you'll 
probably want an X11-based help viewer, e.g. an X11 firefox from Fink:

	env GRACE_HELPVIEWER='firefox %s' xmgrace
<<
DescPort: <<
Configure test for isnan_decl fails - patch includes config.cache
to force the issue.

Apply Debian patches (via J. Howarth) to allow building against fftw3,
among other things.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
We removed doc/ as a vaild subdirectory in configure because the build insists
on regenerating the docs even though the compiled versions are present in the
tarball, so we add the docs manually via Docfiles after having removed the manpages.

Manually move the manpages around to Fink-compliant location.

As of 5.1.22-9: 
Since we install the convcal manpage, might as well
actually put a convcal symlink in %p/bin.  We use update-alternatives
since convcal can be provided either by this package or gracegtk.

Mark the gracerc* files as ConfFiles.

	XQuartz-2.8.0 dropped libXp compile-time files (only retained
	the runtime dylib); disable detection in order to get
	deterministic results.
