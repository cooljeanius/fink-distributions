DescPackaging: <<
	Package-version is of the lcms2mt lib (direct upstream is
	ghostscript, which syncs changes from lcms own upstream at
	their version).  We roll it as a stand-alone library (mupdf
	also uses it).

	Fix symbol visibility. See:
	https://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=703320

	The testbed/testcms program does not appear to use any
	non-public symbols, so we link it fully dynamic (allows
	disabling building the static lib). And that means we can
	allow libtool to do its wrapper-script magic with LD_*
	variables rather than hardcoding it in a platform-dependent
	way in the Makefile.

	Scrap tests for support libs that would only be used by the
	-bin tools that are not being packaged here.

	We're not building plugins at this time, so work around
	ghostscript omitting the automake files for them. See:
	https://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=703871

	Test-suite is badly broken. See:
	https://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=703872

Description: Color management engine (multithreaded)
DescDetail:  <<
This is a fork of lcms2, with an interface-incompatible set of changes
to make it multithreaded.

The lcms2 "icc" utilities are not packaged specifically for the
lcms2mt library fork. Use lcms2-bin if you want them.
