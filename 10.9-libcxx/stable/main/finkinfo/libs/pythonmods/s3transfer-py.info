S3transfer is a Python library for managing
Amazon S3 transfers. This project is
maintained and published by Amazon Web
Services.

This project is not currently GA. If
you are planning to use this code in
production, make sure to lock to a minor
version as interfaces may break from minor
version to minor version. For a basic,
stable interface of s3transfer, try the
interfaces exposed in boto3
