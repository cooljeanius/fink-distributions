Description: Python HTML/XML parser
DescDetail: <<
  Beautiful Soup is a Python HTML/XML parser designed for quick 
  turnaround projects like screen-scraping. Three features make 
  it powerful:
  1. Beautiful Soup won't choke if you give it bad markup. 
     It yields a parse tree that makes approximately as much 
     sense as your original document. This is usually good enough 
     to collect the data you need and run away.
  2. Beautiful Soup provides a few simple methods and Pythonic
     idioms for navigating, searching, and modifying a parse 
     tree: a toolkit for dissecting a document and extracting 
     what you need. You don't have to create a custom parser 
     for each application.
  3. Beautiful Soup automatically converts incoming documents 
     to Unicode and outgoing documents to UTF-8. You don't have 
     to think about encodings, unless the document doesn't specify 
     an encoding and Beautiful Soup can't autodetect one. Then you 
     just have to specify the original encoding.
