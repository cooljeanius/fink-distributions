DescDetail: <<
This is a low-level library for calling build-backends in
pyproject.toml-based project. It provides the basic functionality to
help write tooling that generates distribution files from Python
projects.

If you want a tool that builds Python packages, you'll want to use
https://github.com/pypa/build instead. This is an underlying piece for
pip, build and other "build frontends" use to call "build backends"
within them.

Note: The pep517 project has been replaced by this project (low level)
and the build project (high level).
