Package: execnet-py%type_pkg[python]
# maintenance mode only to support pytest-xdist
Version: 2.0.2
Revision: 1
Type: python (3.7 3.8 3.9 3.10)

Description: Rapid multi-Python deployment
DescDetail: <<
    execnet provides carefully tested means to ad-hoc interact with Python
    interpreters across version, platform and network barriers. It provides
    a minimal and fast API targetting the following uses:
    
    * distribute tasks to local or remote CPUs
    * write and deploy hybrid multi-process applications
    * write scripts to administer a bunch of exec environments
    
    Features:
    
    * zero-install bootstrapping: no remote installation required!
    * flexible communication: send/receive as well as callback/queue
    mechanisms supported
    * simple serialization of python builtin types (no pickling)
    * grouped creation and robust termination of processes
    * well tested between CPython 2.4-3.1, Jython 2.5.1 and PyPy 1.1
    interpreters.
    * fully interoperable between Windows and Unix-ish systems.
